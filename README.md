# Mendix Push Notifications

> Documentation has been moved to [Mendix How-To's](https://docs.mendix.com/howto/mobile/push-notifications)

Push Notifications let your application notify a user of events even when the user is not actively using the application. This is a native capability provided by both Android and iOS devices and made available via Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and Apple Push Notifications service (APNs). This project is meant to make it easy for Mendix developers who want to include Push Notifications capability into their Mendix hybrid mobile application.
